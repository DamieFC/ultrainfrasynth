# ultrainfrasynth
A beep-boop synth that can hopefully play infra- and ultrasound
## So what can  I expect
Right now I want it to be a synth you can play in a browser, then eventually add MIDI support and effects (namely fuzz and wah wah because those are my favorites), and eventually make it an app, or maybe a plugin for Qtractor or something.
## What do you mean by "beep-boop"?
Whaddya think, it means it can make different BEEP and BOOP sounds. DA-HOY!
